What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

When there are two different branches that you want to combine, merging would point both of the ends to a new change that implements these changes. Rebase, however, rewrites these two branches into one and then points that one branch to the new change so everything is linear.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is an online location that allows other computers and people to access the projects.
